# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose

- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (with Product Manager and Business Analyst)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points) with Developers and Scrum Master
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality gates with QA Lead
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map with input from all key roles
