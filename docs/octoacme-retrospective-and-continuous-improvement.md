# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Facilitated by Scrum Master
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure all roles participate (Developers, QA Lead, UX Designer, Product Manager, etc.)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync or daily standup
- Scrum Master tracks action item completion and follows up with owners

_Updated to clarify Scrum Master role per [issue #4](https://github.com/igbera/skills-scale-institutional-knowledge-using-copilot-spaces/issues/4)._
